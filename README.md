Tic Tac Toe Game Project in Python

Introduction:

Tic Tac Toe, a timeless game also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, offers a delightful challenge for two players on a 3x3 grid. The objective is simple: players take turns placing their chosen symbol ('X' or 'O') on the grid, aiming to create a row, column, or diagonal of three symbols before their opponent. A stalemate is declared if the grid fills up without a clear winner.

Project Overview:

In this Python project, we embark on crafting a command-line version of the beloved Tic Tac Toe game. Our journey is divided into clear steps to ensure an organized and systematic development process.
